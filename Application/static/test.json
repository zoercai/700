                    "html": "<p>Seven’s other hosts are a mixed bag, though as long as the big events are actually being shown live we could probably put up with Warwick Capper and an animatronic kangaroo back in the studio. You don’t have to have been an athlete to describe them, of course, but it seems to have helped<strong> </strong>Jim Wilson’s<strong> </strong>career that he at least <em>sounds</em> like one, and an Oss-straylee-unn at that. “We can catch our breath now,” Wilson said at one point as he read out a series of tweets sent on behalf of Michael Phelps’ infant child. It must be exhausting. Much more broadcasterly, ironically, is the work of former jocks Griggs<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Todd Woodbridge,<strong> </strong>while other hosts such Kylie Gillies and Mel McLaughlin have been solid contributors too . </p> \n<p>That’s mostly left Mr Olympics Bruce McAvaney to cool his jets until the athletics events commence, perhaps a good thing while he’s comparing Phelps to Sir Donald Bradman. The sight of McAvaney wearing a gaudy polo shirt was also slightly disconcerting. Wasn’t he born in a network blazer and tie?</p> \n<p>As for the actual commentary, unfairly maligned Zempilas and his analyst Giaan Rooney<strong> </strong>have been, periodic abandonment of impartiality aside, a decent combo in the swimming. Zempilas has mostly resisted the verbose Norman Mayisms of some predecessors and Rooney sounds a hell of a lot happier talking about swimmers lapping up and down a pool very quickly than in other TV roles she’s filled. Funny that. The only time Zempilas truly grates is when he overreaches in search of gravitas. “There’s the record book, then there’s the Michael Phelps book!” he bellowed as the American won the 200m butterfly gold. Not one we’d read, Baz.</p> \n<p>Undoubtedly helped by the compelling performance of the Australian women’s team, Mark Braybrook has been a clear and concise caller of the Rugby Sevens, a compelling spectacle that has revealed itself as ripe for further televisual exploitation, especially with characters as genuinely appealing as Sharni Williams, Charlotte Caslick and Ellia Green. Australia claimed medals in trap shooting and archery too but for all the combined skill and vague sense of danger in those events, in TV terms you suspect they’d be out-rated by surveillance footage from a golf driving range.</p> \n<p>Of the other expert callers, Debbie Watson has been our favourite for explaining the myriad tactical permutations of water polo, which, with no disrespect intended to our glorious Olympians, otherwise appears an entirely lawless game of poison ball played by swimming team delinquents. Over at the equestrian, Martin Gostelow was to our inexpert ears absolutely perfect for his role, in that he sounds like a man who also plays royal tennis and applies his shaving cream with a badger-hair brush.</p> \n<p>The support cast have been energetic enough too. Given the plum job of sideline interviewer at the pool, perma-ecstatic Nathan Templeton peaked early in the role of official specs-holder for golden boy Mack Horton, but crashed back to earth on day two when he misread Emma McKeon’s failure to win a medal in the 100m butterfly final as a moment of mild jubilation and not, as was actually the case, a personal nightmare of tearful proportions. As the awkwardness dawned upon Templeton and he deftly retreated, you wanted to hug both of them. Fortunately they were reunited in happier circumstances when McKeon claimed bronze on Wednesday. It’s a long haul, the swimming.</p> \n<p>The other podium effort so far has come from Seven’s roving news reporter Chris Reason, who doggedly pursued Chinese hero Sun Yang in the wake of his headline-grabbing imbroglio with Horton. Reason’s sustained prodding was rewarded when the swim star eventually stopped in his tracks and snapped: “I don’t know, what is Horton?” There are many ways to avenge a loss but denying your opponent’s very existence is certainly a novel gambit.</p> \n<p>When assessing their various disasters so far, maybe Seven management can look to the Aussies in action for inspiration. Speaking of one mishap by the women’s synchronised diving pair, who couldn’t always nail the seemingly fundamental requirement of landing in the water at the same time, analyst Loudy Wiggins cheerfully suggested: “the judges won’t see that.” They <em>did</em>, of course, but the Aussies still took out bronze regardless. For now the broadcasters themselves remain out of medal contention, but not without hope.</p>"

The last year has sorely tested all of us. It has sorely tested our fans and supporters out there. We have to be mindful of where we’ve come from but our responsibility now is to face the future,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Today’s governance reforms were in large part based on that premise. I genuinely hope they feel what they are watching is competitors doing what they have God-given talent to do and they’re doing it cleanly.</p> \n<p>“The vast majority are. It’s our responsibility to make sure that in future we never return to what we have been dealing with.”</p> \n<p>Coe said none of the athletes he had met in Rio had raised the issue of the IAAF’s decision to bar all but one Russian athlete from the Games, in contrast to the stance taken by other federations that had let the majority compete.</p> \n<p>“I’ve had good and lengthy conversations with a lot of athletes. It is not an issue they are raising with me in any profound way,” he said.</p> \n<p>“We had the usual conversations athletes have – quality of food, comfort of beds.

              "bodyTextSummary": "Black patients are about half as likely to be prescribed opioid medicines in the emergency department than white patients, according to a new study. The findings, published on Monday in Plos One, are the latest to show that minorities are treated differently when it comes to pain management. “A black patient with the same level of pain and everything else being accounted for was much less likely to receive an opioid prescription than a white patient with the same characteristics,” said study co-author Astha Singhal, an assistant professor at Boston University’s dental medicine school. To determine whether there was a racial bias in pain medication prescriptions, the researchers looked at more than 60m records of pain-related emergency department visits from 2007 to 2011 for people aged 18 to 65. Five conditions were examined and divided into two categories: definitive and non-definitive. The first referred to conditions that were easily diagnosed – kidney stones and long-bone fractures – and the second to conditions that are not: toothache, abdominal pain and back pain.\nBlack patients had about half the odds of being prescribed opioids compared to white patients for non-definitive conditions, according to the study, which Singhal co-authored with Renee Hsia of UC San Francisco and Yu-Yu Tien from the University of Iowa. The findings may also point to a contributing factor to the opioid addiction crisis that claims 78 lives in the US a day and has primarily affected the white population, particularly people in rural areas and the north-east. “We think this type of differential prescribing could be contributing to it [the crisis],” said Singhal. The study found no race-based differences for definitive conditions or toothaches, which Singhal said could be because emergency room doctors may be quicker to treat these conditions with medication because they are not dental experts. “This study unfortunately tells us what we already know – black patients are improperly treated for pain and that is mostly because of their skin color,” said Keisha Ray, a postdoctoral fellow with the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. She said the fundamental problem is that black patients are treated as an “other”. This has been suggested for decades, but was starkly depicted in an April study about how disparities in pain management may be attributable to bias from medical providers who believe things such as that black people age more slowly than white people, and that black people’s blood coagulates more quickly than white peoples. “Black patients are not afforded the luxury of being seen in EDs, physician offices, and clinics as just patients in need of help and healing,” Ray said. “Rather they are seen as less than human, drug seekers and overall exaggerators.” Ray and others said that because some clinicians assume black people are more likely to be addicts, they are less likely to receive pain medication. Christopher Ervin, an advisor to the Black Women’s Health Imperative advocacy group, said there is a history of assuming black people are more likely to be addicts, so even if they receive adequate pain treatment in the emergency room, they may not receive a prescription for it once they are discharged. Ervin said these study findings also show how differences in race can amplify the power discordance that exists between a patient and doctor. For instance, a clinician may not recognize someone’s pain because of cultural differences in describing pain. “Many cultures may not be as demonstrative or vocal or assertive about pain and say: ‘Hey, I am hurting,’ particularly when, women in color in general, being vocal is not always to your benefit,” Ervin said. And the dearth of black physicians exacerbates the situation. Only 4% of physicians are black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, and that number is not expected to improve: the association also found that in 2014 fewer black men were in medical school than in 1978. Ervin and the study authors said their findings show the benefits of incorporating sensitivity in medical training to show providers their inherent biases. “If you don’t have that culture of diversity in your training and in your development, when will you get it?” Ervin said. “Until someone sues you.”",

              "bodyTextSummary": "Sevens rugby is new to the Olympics but already it feels like a glorious adornment. Even a rainy night in Rio could not dilute the sudden death drama, with Team GB now facing a semi-final against South Africa after a scarcely believable “golden point” extra-time win over Argentina. A tournament which has also seen Japan reach the last four and New Zealand bow out prematurely is proving to be utterly compelling. GB’s triumph was also among the most perverse international sevens contests ever played, with neither side able to score a single point in normal time. In the abbreviated form of the game this is virtually unheard of, akin to batting out for a draw in T20 cricket.\nThe British medal quest also looked over with seconds remaining after James Davies was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle in front of the posts. The Argentina captain, Gaston Revel, merely had to slot over a regulation drop-goal to seal victory; instead, with the weight of the world on his shoulders, he sliced the greasy ball wide to grant GB an unlikely reprieve. The rules now decreed the first team to score in extra-time would advance, only for GB’s captain, Tom Mitchell, to strike the right upright with a nervous drop-goal effort of his own. Fortunately for Mitchell and his team an Argentinian fumble offered them an immediate second chance and the dangerous Dan Bibby surged through a rare gap to keep the British campaign tantalisingly alive. Neither Bibby nor Davies could quite believe it, having both feared they had missed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. “That’s the first time I’ve ever prayed before that kick,” revealed Davies, the younger brother of the Wales and Lions centre Jonathan. “When I got a yellow card I was thinking: ‘What have I done?’ The guys showed some serious character there. I am just buzzing ... my knees are weak.”\nThe 25-year-old Bibby felt similarly relieved. “When Argentina had a shot, I thought: ‘This could be it, that’s our Olympic dream over.’ But some sort of luck was on our side. We spoke at full-time about keeping calm and not panicking. We played the clock, got our seventh man back on and kept working to force turnovers. “I was just in the right place at the right time. All I was thinking was: ‘Don’t drop it, don’t drop it.’ I’ve never seen a game of sevens like that. I’ve been playing for three or four years and never played in a 0-0 draw, let alone with two missed kicks to win it as well.” Coupled with the earlier 21-19 win over New Zealand, it was a day to encourage hopes of an unexpected medal. Something even more special will be required to beat a strong South African side, who comfortably saw off Australia 22-5, but Davies remains optimistic: “It hasn’t been pretty all week but we’re winning and we’ve come here for one thing. You only get one chance every four years.”\nA can-do attitude has also been driving Japan, who followed up their first day win over New Zealand by defeating France 12-7 thanks to a late try from Teruya Goto. “I thought we’d be lucky to make the quarters, never mind the semis,” admitted his New Zealand-born team-mate Lomano Lemeki. “We’re just having fun with our mates. I thought we’d come here, give it a good go and win a few games. It’s pretty crazy. “We’ve been told to turn our phones off because everyone at home is getting a bit carried away. I think rugby is starting to get bigger than soccer in Japan – which it should because their soccer team’s not that great.” New Zealand, in contrast, have had a tournament to forget. Already beset by injuries they only made the last eight courtesy of a missed USA conversion against Fiji having trailed Great Britain 21-0 at half-time in their final pool game. Injuries to Sonny Bill Williams, Joe Webber and the captain Scott Curry clearly did not help but despite a slight improvement in their quarter-final against Fiji, they went down 12-7. It leaves Fiji, who will now face Japan, on course to secure the first Olympic medal in their country’s history.

We spoke at full-time about keeping calm and not panicking. We played the clock, got our seventh man back on and kept working to force turnovers.</p> \n<p>“I was just in the right place at the right time. All I was thinking was: ‘Don’t drop it, don’t drop it.’ I’ve never seen a game of sevens like that. I’ve been playing for three or four years and never played in a 0-0 draw, let alone with two missed kicks to win it as well.”</p> \n<p>Coupled with the earlier 21-19 win over New Zealand, it was a day to encourage hopes of an unexpected medal. Something even more special will be required to beat a strong South African side, who comfortably saw off Australia 22-5, but Davies remains optimistic: “It hasn’t been pretty all week but we’re winning and we’ve come here for one thing. You only get one chance every four years.”</p>"

              "bodyTextSummary": "Security passes for 300 staff providing services for the lounge areas at Heathrow have been suspended against the backdrop of a police investigation into alleged fraud linked to passes. Two women, aged 20 and 24, were arrested on 28 July and bailed until November on suspicion of fraud and money laundering, Scotland Yard said on Wednesday. Sodexo, a contractor at the airport, subsequently confirmed that the airside passes of around 300 employees were suspended as “as a precautionary measure”. The company said that the move was part of an ongoing investigation and that it was unable to provide further comment. The staff are believed to include cleaners and caterers. Police said other matters had arisen since the arrests, which are believed to relate to airside security passes at Heathrow – one of the busiest airports in the world. The concern is believed to be around the processing of passes, according to Sky News. However, Scotland Yard said there was “no evidence that airside passes have been sold”. A Metropolitan police spokeswoman confirmed two women had been arrested. “They have been arrested in relation to an allegation that money has been fraudulently taken from a bank account,” she said. “Other matters have come to light during the inquiries and form part of the ongoing investigation.” Permanent and temporary passes are provided to flight crews, baggage handlers and a range of other staff working at Heathrow, which has around 70,000 workers.\nTighter checks for airport staff and stronger restrictions on access to sensitive areas were introduced in 2002 following two multi-million pound robberies at the airport. Current vetting require applicants for airside passes to provide five years’ employment references without gaps. Although there is no indication that the arrests and the suspension of the airside passes are in any way terror-related, they come at a time when concerns about airport security have been brought into sharp focus once again in the wake of the attack on Brussels airport earlier this year. Aviation security in the UK is under constant review, according to the Department for Transport, while an increased police presence at Heathrow is believed to have been in place for some time. As recently as last month, a transport minister said that the government was taking “all steps necessary to keep the public safe” after a threat was reportedly made against the airport. An alert from non-governmental counter-terrorism organisation Site Intelligence Group warned of a threat being made by a “pro-Islamic State Twitter account”. It was reported to have threatened attacks on planes flying from Heathrow to the US across the US Independence Day holiday weekend. The alert also warned “there will be a device placed in either Heathrow, LAX [Los Angeles] or JFK [New York] airports”. Speaking about the latest concerns over access, the Department for Transport said: “We are aware of this issue. Safety and security of passengers is our priority.” “We keep aviation security under constant review, but as this matter is the subject of an ongoing police investigation we are unable to comment further at this time.”",

              "bodyTextSummary": "The chief inspector of prisons has praised an immigration detention centre for families facing forced removal from Britain, which ministers have decided to close. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector, says Cedars, which opened in 2011 near Gatwick airport, has been a “groundbreaking facility” that will now be lost despite significant human and financial investment over the past few years. “Cedars produced the best outcomes for detainees that we have seen anywhere in immigration detention,” Clarke says in his report on an unannounced inspection of the centre carried out in June, before its closure was announced.\nRobert Goodwill, the new immigration minister who announced the closure of the facility on 21 July, said the decision had been taken on grounds of value for money, reflecting its low level of use in the past few years as more families facing removal chose to return to their home countries voluntarily. Goodwill said a “discrete unit” within the nearby Tinsley House immigration removal centre would be used instead. There is a 72-hour limit on the detention of families with children, extendable to up to seven days with ministerial authorisation. Cedars, a large Edwardian house with extensive grounds, was opened as a secure facility to detain families as a result of a Liberal Democrat initiative in the coalition government in 2010 to end the routine immigration detention of children.\nA family returns policy, overseen by an independent panel, was set up with an emphasis on voluntary returns and Cedars was opened to be used only as a last resort. The number of children detained fell from 1,119 in 2009 to 110 in the year to March 2016. In his report, the chief inspector of prisons confirms that Cedars has been little used since it was last inspected in 2014, with 46 families having been held there and only 16 of them being removed from Britain. “The low and decreasing level of use was ascribed by the Home Office to the success of the returns process and the fact that more families were accepting voluntary assistance to leave the UK. In addition, two recent reports had made reference to the cost of Cedars,” says Clarke in his introduction. He adds that 2,442 families have “entered the family returns process” since 2014, 1,597 of which have been removed from Britain. The inspection report says the centre has been fitted out to a very high standard, with a kitchen and sitting room in each family apartment. There is also a fitness room, library, IT room, chapel, playroom and lounge areas.

He adds that force has not been used since the last inspection, nor family separation. The decision by Home Office ministers to use a “discrete unit” in Tinsley House has been criticised by the chief executive of Barnardo’s, Javed Khan. “We do not feel that the new proposed accommodation is in the best interests of the children and have told ministers we cannot support the move,” he said.

              "bodyTextSummary": "New powers to cut off illicit mobile phones used by prisoners to run criminal operations have been introduced in jails across England and Wales. The use of mobile phones by prisoners has long been banned but enforcement measures have so far proved ineffective, with more than 15,000 mobile phones and sim cards recovered in jails last year. In recent years, one prisoner used his illicit mobile to arrange the murder of a rival gang leader from his cell; another organised huge shipments of cocaine from South America. A third even managed to import a consignment of submachine guns into Britain from Germany. The new powers, introduced this week, will enable prison authorities to secure civil court orders requiring mobile network operators to blacklist handsets and disconnect sim cards.\nThe new telecommunications restriction orders contained in the recent Serious Crime Act mean prison governors will no longer have to physically find illegally held mobiles. Instead, prison authorities will use routine phone-surveillance systems to identify illicit devices being used within their facility. Details will be passed to police so an application for a telecommunications restriction order can be made. The Home Office security minister, Ben Wallace, said the orders provided the power to disconnect phones used by prisoners to orchestrate serious crimes while in jail. “Criminals are locked up to protect communities from their actions, so it is totally unacceptable for them to continue their life of crime behind bars,” he added. The measure has also been endorsed by the new justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss. “We are determined to do all we can to prevent prisoners having access to mobile phones,” she said. “We are stepping up measures to find and block them and empowering prison officers to take action. I am determined to make sure our prisons are safe and places of rehabilitation.”\nHowever, the effectiveness of the new powers has been questioned by the former chief inspector of prisons, David Ramsbotham. He told a parliamentary scrutiny committee earlier this year that the installation of technology in every prison in England and Wales blocking the use of all mobile phones would be far simpler and more effective than “passing the buck” to the network operators. But the Home Office ruled out this option, saying it would cost £300m to install blocking technology in every jail in England and Wales and a further £800,000 a year to maintain it. The introduction of targeted telecommunications restriction orders will cost £3.3m over 10 years. Lord Ramsbotham also said the new orders could be undermined by people smuggling new sim cards into jails, and suggested that large numbers of court orders would be needed. Recent cases in which prisoners have used illicit mobile phones include that of Izzet Eren, who arranged from his cell in Wormwood Scrubs for a gang to spring him from a custody van when he was being taken to court. Christopher Welsh ran a massive drug-smuggling operation, while Alexander Mullings masterminded a plot from his Wandsworth cell to import submachine guns.",

              "bodyTextSummary": "There’s the father who threatened to kill his children four times. The girl under six who was bullied, allegedly sexually abused and became the subject of 60 separate reports over two years. And there’s the woman whose apparent psychotic episodes became the subject of a debate over whether she was “putting it on”. Sometimes the incidents recorded in the Nauru files appear as one-offs. But often they follow a pattern. A cry for help would become a threat, a threat would become an act, the act would be belatedly and often inadequately handled. Rinse, repeat.\nThe files show the progression of trauma as individuals’ distress escalated without remedy. A sample explored below are among countless stories of men, women and children growing increasingly distressed, some falling into deep mental illnesses, and some threatening violence against themselves or their families. The pattern is displayed in the thousands of pages of documents. But what isn’t shown, according to some former employees, are caseworkers “going ballistic” behind the scenes. “We’re watching it and yelling at our managers,” one said. “That’s all we can do. That’s what it is all the time. That’s what is happening.” ‘I’m ready for her to die’ A father in Nauru threatened to kill himself and his children at least three times before the children were eventually moved, the Nauru files show. The man first reached out to caseworkers in July 2014 to say he wanted to relinquish care of his children. He was “failing as their father and it’s torturing me”, he told one. The caseworker passed on the information to high welfare watch, and said a senior caseworker would see the man again the following week.

Despite the history of threats he was told his children would be “accommodated” for just one night, but only if he signed a consent form. He refused, believing the form would be “held against him”, the report said.

He was also given information regarding the Nauruan criminal code and was pointed to relevant sections (286, 308, 359, 364). Eight days later the father told a caseworker he would not harm the children but would kill himself. The next month the family appeared to be reunited, according to a report which described the father yelling at his daughter after she engaged in “defiant behaviour” towards staff, warning that Safe the Children might take her away from him. ‘She kicked me to the floor’ Separately in 2014 to 2015 there were at least 60 incident reports filed which related to one child under the age of six.

During late September and early October 2014 dozens of people self-harmed, protests escalated, the centre was in crisis. Numerous detainees warned of impending chaos.\nChildren warned of plans to set fires. One detainee told a caseworker he was happy because it felt like “the calm before the storm” and there was a group of people planning a big event to “show people that we are here”. Others warned of plans for a mass suicide attempt. In early 2015 a detainee self-harmed by consuming washing detergent six months after he told a caseworker he wished for some poison to take his own life. In the same year a woman was so distressed about missing her husband, who was in Australia, that she carved his name into her chest. She was struggling with being a single mother and told caseworkers she believed that if she was “out of the picture” the Australian immigration department would send her child to live with their father. Six days later she attempted suicide. In the coming weeks she expressed fear she would kill her child “because I cannot control him”. The following month she said she would take her own life if the department did not respond to her request to be reunited with her husband. How this happens These cases are not outliers. According to former detention centre employees this was – for at least the time they were there – the usual trajectory for people trapped in an incoherent response system which allows the hierarchy of service providers to trump expertise. This meant a security company employee could and sometimes would overrule a case manager on a mental health or child protection case. “The child protection manager could be talking till they’re blue in the face,” one former detention centre employee told the Guardian. A former centre employee described one case of a woman who appears fleetingly in the files, who had an apparent psychotic episode. Despite the urging of caseworkers to have her medically evacuated for psychiatric care, the former employee said, a Wilson’s employee decided instead they should encourage the woman to practise “self-care” because they believed she was “putting it on”. “She was in psychosis. Even I could see. She couldn’t focus, she couldn’t have a conversation.” They said the woman’s condition worsened and she was eventually medevacked out of Nauru. Peter Young, the former head of mental health services for the health provider International Health and Medical Services, said Save the Children was supposed to be the equivalent of a child protection agency but had to do that “without any sort of legislative framework at all and without any sort of capacity for the Nauruans to investigate”.\nIt was not until May this year that clearer laws relating to child neglect were passed among a raft of Nauruan legislative updates which also included decriminalising suicide and broadening the definition of rape to apply it to married and de facto couples. A man may threaten or hit his children, or be accused of assaulting others, but there is no child protection framework on Nauru to trigger a response, as would happen in Australia. The children could be moved no further than to another part of the crowded centre. “There wasn’t anywhere to remove them to. There wasn’t any infrastructure which allowed that,” Young said. “Particularly when it was aspects of the environment driving the behaviour of the parents, when they were at their wit’s end themselves, there was literally no room to move. “There were lots of cases where because people were so closely crowded, the tents they were living in, they were continually exposed to the people abusing them.” • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

Despite the urging of caseworkers to have her medically evacuated for psychiatric care, the former employee said, a Wilson’s employee decided instead they should encourage the woman to practise “self-care” because they believed she was “putting it on”. “She was in psychosis. Even I could see. She couldn’t focus, she couldn’t have a conversation.”</p> \n<p>They said the woman’s condition worsened and she was eventually medevacked out of Nauru.</p> \n<p>Peter Young, the former head of mental health services for the health provider International Health and Medical Services, said Save the Children was supposed to be the equivalent of a child protection agency but had to do that “without any sort of legislative framework at all and without any sort of capacity for the Nauruans to investigate”.</p>"

              "bodyTextSummary": "The census website has been restored on Thursday after a day of recriminations with Malcolm Turnbull and senior ministers blaming the Australian Bureau of Statistics and IBM for the failure. Malcolm Turnbull has said a denial of service attack before the census website outage on Tuesday “should have been repelled” and and has shifted blame to IBM for the systems failure. But at a press conference in Canberra, Turnbull conceded the denial of service attack did not cause the systems failure, but rather apparently “anomalous traffic” which led the Australian Bureau of Statistics to take the census down. In an interview with 2GB radio Turnbull revealed the census website should be back online on Thursday. The site was restored shortly before 3pm, 43 hours after it was taken down at 7:45pm on Tuesday evening. However some users are reporting delays in trying to access the site as the site comes back online.\nDavid Kalisch, head of the ABS, apologised for the inconvenience at a press conference later on Thursday but said, with the census form now back online, “we are on track to conduct a high-quality online census”. He did not take questions. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said IBM had “questions to answer” about why measures to stop the attack weren’t in place. The comments contrast with the first explanation provided by the small business minister, Michael McCormack, who said on Wednesday the ABS’s “overcautious” approach, taking the system offline after the technical failure, was to blame. Cybersecurity chief Alastair MacGibbon warned on Thursday the census website was likely to face even more vigorous denial of service attacks when it was restored.\nTurnbull said: “Measures that ought to have been in place to prevent these denial of service attacks interfering with access to the website were not put in place – that is a fact, that was a failure.” He explained that was compounded by a failure in hardware and “inadequate redundancy” a further indication the capacity of the system itself rather than the scale of the attack was to blame. Turnbull said the failures had now been rectified and the site would probably be restored on Thursday. Turnbull said denial of service attacks were “completely predictable” and “should have been repelled readily”. “They weren’t because of the failure of systems put in for the [Australian Bureau of Statistics] by IBM.” He said there were “clearly very big issues for IBM – the provider of the systems – and the ABS itself”. At a press conference in Canberra, Turnbull blamed hardware failure and “anomalous traffic on the night – it appeared to be anomalous actually it was quite innocent it turned out – but that caused the ABS to take the site down”. “The site was not crashed by denial of service but it was a confluence of events that caused the ABS to make that decision. “But there is no doubt there was a failure on the part of ABS and the systems provider.” In the radio interview, Turnbull said he was “very angry and bitterly disappointed” and said the root cause of the problem was “measures that ought to have been in place” that were not. Asked if anyone would be sacked over the census failure, Turnbull predicted there would be “serious consequences” after a review by MacGibbon. When radio host Alan Jones singled out former assistant minister to the treasurer Alex Hawke for criticism, Turnbull said the issue of “which heads should roll, where and when” would be decided after the review.\nThe shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, told ABC’s AM radio program Turnbull’s comments were “unseemly finger pointing after the event”. “I thought it was pretty pathetic to hear the prime minister blaming the ABS for what is essentially a failure of leadership on his part,” he said. Speaking on 2GB with Ray Hadley on Thursday, Dutton said the ABS and McCormack had “done their best” and “lessons were learned”. “The contractors, IBM, will have questions to answer about why the appropriate measures weren’t put in place.” At a press conference in Melbourne, Bill Shorten, said: “The census happens every five years. It costs hundreds of millions of dollars. There are ministers responsible for the census.” “Now we wake up Thursday morning and Malcolm Turnbull and his whole Liberal-National ministry front-bench, none of them are apparently responsible for anything. How can it be?” In another sign of anger at IBM, former Queensland premier Campbell Newman tweeted a link to an article about his government blacklisting IBM from future state contracts in 2013 after a scathing report into the IT giant’s part in the state’s health payroll bungle. The comments are likely to draw attention to the capacity of the system provided by IBM to the ABS and the specifications required by the contract for it. On Wednesday, cyber security expert Suelette Dreyfus told the ABC’s The Drum program IT contractors were not necessarily to blame for systems failures. “Sometimes governments understate the size of what it is they say that they want. Because they haven’t scoped it properly or because they don’t want to pay for it properly,” she said. On ABC News Breakfast, MacGibbon said the ABS had taken some time to prepare the site for further attacks, including providing “a lot more redundancy and some greater depth to the security”.\n“We shouldn’t have had those types of hardware failures. “We should have been able to make sure that we had redundancies, so anyone that’s ever run an IT system will tell you from time to time, these computers and boxes fall over.” Asked if there would be further denial of service attacks when the site was restored on Thursday, MacGibbon said: “I think it’s only logical that that’s going to happen. Probably with more vigour than we saw a few nights ago.” MacGibbon said every effort had been made to ensure the site was robust, but there were no absolute guarantees it would not suffer a further failure. Jones also grilled Turnbull over whether it was “duplicitous” of the treasurer, Scott Morrison, to approve sale of Carlton Hill and Ivanhoe agricultural land to foreign owners before the election without telling voters. Turnbull said he would “resist that innuendo or allegation” and did not have details of the sales to hand. He said the foreign investment review board decisions were “rigorous and objective” and directed further questions to Morrison. Guardian Australia is seeking a response from IBM.",

              "bodyTextSummary": "Aston Villa’s manager Roberto Di Matteo has called for his side to go back to basics after crashing out of the EFL Cup with a 3-1 defeat to League Two Luton Town. The Villa manager, who has now lost his first two competitive games since taking charge of the club, saw the hangover from relegation out of the Premier League continue as they were deservedly knocked out by the Hatters. Villa dominated the opening 20 minutes, hitting the frame of the goal twice and taking the lead through Jordan Ayew’s 13th-minute goal. But Luton levelled nine minutes before the interval through Jake Gray before Cameron McGeehan put Luton ahead early in the second half and Jores Okore comically put through his own net in the 66th minute.\nDi Matteo said: “We went deservedly ahead, and then let Luton back into the game as second half they dominated us and we looked disjointed as a team. “It wasn’t a team performance, also difficult to explain from first half to second half how we changed so much.” Villa are without a win in any competition since February 6 and Di Matteo admitted the team need to toughen up mentally. The former Chelsea manager added: “Certainly there’s some fragility there, because after we conceded the equaliser you could see they were a little bit nervous, but I didn’t expect in the second half we would play like that. “We have to work together as a team and try to get a win and grow their confidence. We let ourselves down and lose games, so we probably have to go back to basics, defend well, defend our box and take our chances. We did create chances but we need to make sure we don’t concede so easily.” Luton manager Nathan Jones was thrilled with his players. He said: “I’m very, very proud, I thought they were excellent. “We started very slowly but once we realised we could affect a football game against Aston Villa, I thought we were excellent, especially second half. “They showed they could competed first half but second half they showed a real desire to win a football match and I thought we were excellent. “We had a little bit of fortune at times, they hit the woodwork, but it was slim margins.” Luton Town were rewarded with a home tie against Leeds United, who defeated Fleetwood Town 5-4 on penalties. QPR, the night’s other victors from the spot when they defeated Swindon after a 2-2 draw, got a home game against Rochdale. Burton Albion got themselves a plum draw for the second round of the League Cup, newly branded as the EFL Cup from this season, when they were handed a home game against Liverpool. Albion, managed by an Anfield old boy Nigel Clough, defeated Bury 3-2 after extra time and started their first ever season in the Championship only on Saturday against another of his former clubs, Nottingham Forest, and lost it 4-3. Liverpool, eight times winners of the League Cup, the last of them in 2012 under Kenny Dalglish, got to the final last year and lost it on penalties to Manchester City after a 1-1 draw. Chelsea will host one of the Bristol clubs at Stamford Bridge – depending on the winner of the Bristol Rovers v Cardiff City game on Thursday, as the draw was seeded. Newcastle United will take on Cheltenham Town, who provided the upset of Tuesday with a 1-0 home win over Charlton. Everton will face Yeovil Town for the first time in a competitive fixture and Sunderland get to face lowly Shrewsbury Town, which may provoke unhappy memories for the new manager David Moyes, who lost a third-round FA Cup tie against them with Everton 13 years ago. Millwall face Nottingham Forest, Accrington play Burnley in a Lancashire derby and Norwich City, the 1985 winners when it was called the Milk Cup, will face Coventry City, Crystal Palace will host Blackpool and Watford will take on Gillingham at Vicarage Road.

              "bodyTextSummary": "Australia’s grubby little secret is secret no more. The truth of the offshore detention regime financed, controlled and run by Australian government on the remote Pacific island of Nauru has been brutally exposed by the revelation by the Guardian of the Nauru files. For all of the extreme measures to which the Australian government has gone to keep its offshore detention regime from public eye – moving detention centres to remote foreign islands where compliant local governments keep journalists away; an extreme and unapologetic secrecy about the “on-water matters” of boat turnbacks; legislation to jail doctors and detention centre workers who speak out on behalf of those held; and restricting access for international agencies such as the United Nations – the truth about its remote camps has continued to leak out over the four years of offshore detention. Now, it is laid bare. The Nauru files are the most comprehensive insight into conditions in the island detention camp that the Australian public has ever been given. They reveal suicide attempts so common as to be unremarkable: refugees find their friends hanging by their neck from bedsheets, barely conscious and moments from death; children calmly report their parents have swallowed screws and will be dead soon; parents coldly reveal their plans to carry their children as they walk into the sea.\nThey show children left in states of extreme vulnerability and danger: a father, citing lack of proper medical care and his feeling he is “failing as their father and it’s torturing me”, threatens to kill himself and his children on three separate occasions before there is intervention; a girl becomes the subject of more than 60 incident reports that reveal she has been sexually abused and has self-harmed; another girl, aged under 10, also the victim of sexual abuse, undresses in front of a group of adults and invites them to stick their fingers into her vagina.\nThey expose the basic privation of detention: people refusing to use fetid toilets that haven’t been cleaned for weeks; women bullied into exposing their bodies to guards so they can have enough water to shower; women suffering incontinence denied sanitary pads. And the Nauru files unveil how conditions in the camps are clinically euphemised for the outside world: critical incidents, in which refugees have attempted to kill themselves, or are raped or assaulted, are downgraded to the classifications “major” or “minor”, ensuring that Wilson – the security subcontractor on the island – won’t be fined for failing to report them in time; doctors’ orders that someone be moved for urgent medical treatment are overruled by a department slavishly determined to uphold a policy, regardless of medical consequence. The dry, disengaged language reduces the endless cycle of crises to mundanity. The cache of documents is, at once, horrific and banal.\nThe systemic failures of the Nauru detention regime have been known previously. Alongside the testimony of those detained on the island, and of those who have worked there, evidence has emerged in government inquiries and reports, in parliamentary committees, and in the promises that problems have been addressed and improved. But the Nauru files are damning, and they are damning because they are the words of the detention system itself, the regime’s own bureaucracy revealing its casual, callous brutality. This is the machine revealing itself to be awful, and just how awful it is. The files prove how the organisations running the island camp – including the Department of Immigration and Border Protection – deliberately seek to suppress the reality of the island being revealed, to stop information getting out. They demonstrate how the detention regime’s massive bureaucracy is used to obfuscate, mislead, and distort information. The downgrading of reports allows those running the camps to sanitise the conditions inside them, to claim that the situation is better than they are, to report to their Canberra superiors and paymasters that life in the detention centre, on the island, is under control, even improving. But the whitewashing can only cover so much. The files vindicate the whistleblowers of the Nauru regime. People such as the traumatologist and psychologist Paul Stevenson, who said conditions on Nauru were the worst “atrocity” he had ever seen in 40 years working with the victims of terrorist attacks and natural disasters, people such as Dr Peter Young, formerly the chief psychiatrist responsible for the care of asylum seekers on the island, who said the camps were “inherently toxic” and that the immigration department deliberately harmed vulnerable detainees in a process akin to torture. The files clearly demonstrate the broader trends on the island: that mental health deteriorates precipitously the longer people are held; that the clinical advice of doctors is overridden by bureaucrats insistent that “the policy” be upheld; and, most disturbingly, that children are, by far, the most damaged by the nature and fact of indefinite detention on Nauru.\nChildren carry the additional burden of keeping their parents alive – mothers and fathers regularly report they would kill themselves were it not for their children. When even that is not enough, children are regularly the ones who raise the alarm when their parents do try to take their own lives, often in the forlorn hope it will mean their orphaned offspring will be moved to Australia. Nauru is but one in a line of “solutions” engineered by Australia to address the issue of irregular migration (“solution” implying that people fleeing is a novel problem rather than a millennia-old human activity, and a domestic issue at that, one that can be fixed with a simple, single fix). Australia now has a suite of these failed “solutions”: the Pacific, the Malaysia (struck down by the high court in 2012), the Papua New Guinea, the Nauru, the Cambodia. None have been solutions at all. Fundamentally, Australia’s “Nauru solution” is built on one fundamental lie – that this place is any kind of answer at all. It is a lie enabled by countless deceits every single day. Those are revealed in the Nauru files. • You can support important journalism like this by making a one-off or monthly contribution",

              "bodyTextSummary": "The head of the competition regulator has said Australia’s major banks are making huge margins on credit cards with the gap between credit card interest rates and the Reserve Bank’s official interest rate now at a record high. Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said the big banks were clearly charging interest rates “considerably above costs” and it was something “that needs to be looked at”. The gap between credit card rates and the official cash rate is now more than 18% – the largest it has been in 27 years, since data has been kept – after the major banks failed to pass on any of the Reserve Bank’s rate cut last week to credit card holders. Labor leader Bill Shorten has called on the banks to explain themselves, saying there is no reason the gap should be so big. “There is no case being made by the banks for the reason why, whenever is there is a reduction in interest rates, even if they pass some of it through to mortgages and some through to depositors, you never see significant reductions in credit card interest rates,” he said on Wednesday.\n“Deposits are relatively low return, but credit card interest rates are relatively high. And it’s not good enough for the banks to ignore credit card holders, mortgagees and small businesses just in the pursuit of bigger and bigger, bloated bottom line.” The Commonwealth Bank unveiled a record full-year profit after tax of $9.45bn on Wednesday, an increase of 3% on last year, just a week after refusing to pass on the rate cut in full to mortgage holders. Ian Narev, the Commonwealth Bank’s chief executive, defended his decision not to pass on the RBA’s full rate cut, saying whenever the cash rate was lowered it made life harder for depositors whose income relies on interest rates. Sims told Guardian Australia it was clear the state of competition in the credit card sector needed investigating., given the gap between the cash rate and interest rates on credit cards. “It’s a classic example of, you look at that and you say how does that continue?” he said. “Now, it may not just be a competition issue, in terms of entry barriers and how they manage to keep that market so lucrative. “It could be something that needs to be looked at from the consumer side as well, like why are consumers so sticky [and don’t shop around for the best offer]. “It’s a key sector of competition you’d want to understand better. Those are huge margins. They’re clearly charging interest rates considerably above cost.” Asked why the CBA did not pass on any of the Reserve Bank’s rate cut to credit card customers, a CBA bank spokesman said only: “The official cash rate is only one factor in determining the interest rates on credit cards. Credit card interest rates are determined in a different way from home loans as they are a form of credit that is not secured to assets.” Sims said he was looking forward to to a Productivity Commission review of competition in the banking sector, flagged by the Coalition in response to the financial system inquiry. He said the review must look at the credit card sector.",

This is the epitome of men’s gymnastics, a battle across half a dozen disciplines between 24 of the most overall athletically impressive competitors in the entire Games.</p> \n<p>All eyes will be on Japan’s Kohei Uchimura, the dominant star of London 2012, where he won five medals. He is also the reigning world champion but could only finish second in qualifying to Oleg Verniaiev of Ukraine. David Belyavskiy was the next best. But, who knows, maybe Uchimura was holding something back on Sunday? He was also in the Japan team that triumphed in the team event on Monday.</p> \n<p>Who else should we watch out for? Team USA have two representatives, Sam Mikulak (seventh in qualifying) and Chris Brooks (19th); Team GB will have their main man Max Whitlock (12th) and Nile Wilson (fifth); the hosts will be going wild for Arthur Mariano and Sergio Sasaki.</p> \n<p>So get set for the vault, floor, pommel horse, rings, parallel bars and high bar. The events gets underway at 4pm in Rio (8pm in London, 3pm in New York, 5am in Sydney). It’s going to be stunning.</p>"

If I’d missed the Euros, it would have been tough on me, mentally and physically, because I would have had seven weeks off and that was the last thing I needed after having seven or eight months off in the season.”</p> \n<p>Wilshere was not able to show his best form in France, partly because he had not found his groove beforehand and, also, because England players rarely do at major tournaments. He is now preoccupied by the rebuild: to recovering the trust and feeling his way back.</p> \n<p>He does not want to set “any ridiculous targets”, merely to play as much as possible up until Christmas and then reassess. But he will not be playing in the Premier League season opener at home to Liverpool on Sunday because of the knee injury that he picked up at the end of last month. At least he is back in full training.</p> \n<p>“I know my body better than ever now and I know what it can and can’t do,” Wilshere says. “What it can’t do is go into ridiculous challenges, especially in training. It’s more difficult in a game but in training I can take myself out of those situations. It is something I will definitely be working on – not going into challenges that are 20-80.”</p> \n<p>Competition for places in the Arsenal midfield will be more intense, after the summer purchase of Granit Xhaka from Borussia Mönchengladbach – a player Wilshere describes as a “good signing for us”. It is in other areas that many fans believe Arsène Wenger must strengthen – namely up front and, to react to the serious injuries to Per Mertesacker and Gabriel, in central defence. Wilshere has not been afraid to call for signings in the past yet he believes that the squad is “strong enough” as is it.</p> \n<p>“Maybe we could add a defender because we have picked up some injuries but, apart from that, our squad is good,” he says, talking near to the Emirates Stadium on a community pitch that has benefited from Premier League investment.</p>"

They are top, top players.” How Arsenal would love to soothe the nerves of their support with a victory over Liverpool.</p> \n<p>For England, a positive start under Allardyce would be a tonic. The first qualifying tie for the 2018 World Cup is away to Slovakia on 4 September.</p> \n<p>“I think it’s important that the England manager is English,” Wilshere says. “He [Allardyce] knows what playing for England is all about.</p> \n<p>“Watching his teams, the one thing that stands out is that they are organised.</p> \n<p>“People talk about his style of play but he does what it takes to win games. That will be a positive thing for us.”</p>"
